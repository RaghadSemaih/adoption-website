# adoption-website
This project was developed by me and my team. The idea was to build a simple yet functional website for pet adoption we named it adaptly, where users can view and adopt pets.

Technologies Used:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
PHP
MySQL
My Role: I was responsible for creating and designing the Home Page (index), connecting it to the database, and managing the backend database operations. This included:

Fetching dynamic data from the database and displaying it on the homepage.
Writing PHP scripts for database interaction.
Designing and maintaining the structure of the database.
This project helped me gain hands-on experience in front-end and back-end integration, as well as working in a team to complete a real-world web system.
